        <h3 is-upgraded><strong>What is linux?</strong></h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system used on mobile devices (Android), the cloud, embedded systems, desktops and servers. An operating system is a bit of software that manages the connection between software and hardware.</p>
<p>Linux is based on the unix operating system which was developed in 1969. Unix was a proprietary operating system and not open source, Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel as an open source alternative and released the first version in 1991. Linux is released under a General Public Licence, which means users are free to run, study, share and modify the software. </p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Linux Kernel</strong></h3>
<p>A kernel is the part of an operating system that communicates with the hardware. It is responsible for  managing the resources of a computer (the CPU, storage etc). The Linux kernel is based on the original Unix Kernel. </p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Distributions </strong></h3>
<p>A Linux distribution is an operating system package containing the Linux kernel and a package management system (a way of accessing software). There are many different distributions, some of which target particular groups of users such as education, enterprise or developers. </p>
<p>Some of the most popular distributions are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>RedHat </li>
<li>Debian </li>
<li>Fedora </li>
</ul>
<p>But there are many more.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Ubuntu" duration="0">
        <p>Ubuntu is the distribution we will be using for this course. It&#39;s great for beginners but also provides all the tools we need for both Software Development and Cloud Engineering.</p>
<p>Ubunutu comes in three different forms</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop </li>
<li>Server</li>
<li>IoT</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using the desktop version of ubuntu. It comes with the Linux kernel, a Graphic User Interface, free open source software and access to a package manager. </p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Installing Ubuntu</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/#download" target="_blank">https://ubuntu.com/#download</a></p>
<p>Ubuntu can be downloaded at the above link. </p>
<p>There are many different versions of Ubunutu but we will be using the current LTS (Long Term Support). The LTS versions of Ubuntu are the most stable and are given security updates by canonical (the creators of Ubuntu) for a longer time compared to the non LTS versions.</p>
<p>The current LTS version is 22.04. </p>
<p>There are multiple ways to install Ubuntu once we have downloaded it. </p>
<p>We could install it as our primary Operating System, similar to how you currently have Windows or Mac OS installed, however that would mean either creating a partition on your hard drive or completing replacing your current operating system. </p>
<p>For ease of use, we will be running Ubuntu in what&#39;s known as a virtual machine.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Virtual Box</strong></h3>
<p>Virtual Box is a piece of software that we can use to create a virtual machine. You can think of a virtual machine as a virtual computer running inside your actual computer. </p>
<p>Virtual Box runs on all major operating systems. </p>
<p>You can download Virtual Box by visiting and downloading the appropriate version for your OS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a></p>
<p>When opening Virtual Box for the first time, it should look similar to the image below. There may some variation depending on which OS you are using. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d926bd667135212.png"></p>
<p>To create a new VM (Virtual Machine), we need to click new. </p>
<p>Select the below settings, with the exception of &#34;Machine Folder&#34; which should reflect a file path for your own machine. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/e9e3482d73243c0e.png"></p>
<p>We will need to allocate an amount of RAM for the virtual machine to use, this will vary depending on how much you have on your computer, but I would recommend at least 4096MB, if possible. </p>
<p>We also need to allocate some storage space for our virtual machine to use. Once again This will depend on the storage space you have available but I would recommend at least 50GB for our purposes. Virtual Box will ask you which type of storage we want to use, the options it gives us are essentially just different formats. We will be using VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image). </p>
<p>We also have the option of choosing between Dynamically sized storage and Fixed size storage. VirtualBox explains the difference, we will be using Dynamically Sized. </p>
<p>We can now see that VirtualBox has created our virtual machine for us. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/2afed4afade8fdeb.png"></p>
<p>There are a couple of settings we need to change. You can access settings by clicking the settings icon. </p>
<p>We are going to change the following settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>General -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Shared Clipboard -&gt; Bidirectional</li>
<li>System -&gt; Processor -&gt; Processors -&gt; 2CPU</li>
<li>Display -&gt; Screen -&gt; Enable 3D Acceleration</li>
<li>Storage, This is where we will add the Ubuntu image we downloaded earlier <br>Select IDE -&gt; Empty -&gt; Press the disk icon on the right hand side -&gt; Choose a disk file -&gt; Select the Ubuntu file we downloaded earlier. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#39;re happy with your changes hit the ok button. </p>
<p>To start the VM, press the green start button. </p>

      <google-codelab-step label="The Linux Desktop Environment" duration="0">
        <p>The first time you boot up Ubuntu, it will ask you if you want to try or install it. Select Install, the try option allows you to test out Ubuntu without actually installing it on your machine, this is a great option when you want to try out Ubuntu for compatibility with your hardware etc. </p>
<p>When prompted for which type of installing you would like, select Normal, this ensures we get access to the open source software Ubuntu comes with. </p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Desktop Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Our version of Ubuntu comes with a desktop environment also known as a GUI (Graphical User Interface). I fully recommend exploring it to get used to everything Ubuntu has to offer, it should be pretty familiar to anyone coming from either Windows or Mac OS. </p>
<p>For this introduction, I will cover some of the features. </p>
<p>If you click the folder icon on the left hand bar, the file explorer will open. This is where we can access all the files and folders on our VM as well as create new files and folders. </p>
<p>In the bottom left corner we have a shortcut to our applications. By clicking this icon we are able to see all of our installed applications. You can use your mouse&#39;s scroll wheel to navigate to additional pages of applications. </p>
<p>Ubuntu comes with a bunch of free software, including a web browser, a mail client, an office package similar to Microsoft Office, as well as software for playing music and viewing photos. Feel free to explore these in your own time. </p>
<p>There is also &#34;Ubuntu Software&#34;, where we can install new software as well as update our existing software. </p>
<p>If you ever need help navigating Ubuntu, there is a huge community and the answer can usually be found via a simple google search. There is also a built-in Desktop Guide which can be accessed by pressing the question mark icon with a blue background on the left hand bar. </p>

      <google-codelab-step label="The Terminal" duration="0">
        <p>The terminal is where we can utilize the power of Linux. This is where we can write commands that carry out operations on our computer. Whilst we can do many things in the Desktop Environment, the true power of Linux comes in the form of these commands in the terminal and mastering these commands can make using the OS much more easier and enjoyable. </p>
<p>We can open the terminal by pressing CTRL + ALT + T, or you can find it in Applications. </p>
